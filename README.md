# U5-Java-Strings
 Learned the different ways you can create and work with strings.
JavaScript provides additional functionality to use with strings via "properties" and "methods." Learned how to use the '.length' property, as well as the '.toUpperCase()' and '.toLowerCase()' methods. JavaScript provides a more intuitive way to work with strings with a feature called "template literals." Template literals not only make your code more usable and readable, but they also enhance how you work with strings.
